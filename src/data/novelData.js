<span class="float-left text-6xl font-title text-orange-800 mr-3 mt-[-6px] leading-none">L</span>aughter fills the chamber of a dimly lit tavern; you can barely hear the boots stick to the wooden floor as the waitress scurries to fill drink orders. Ale spilt by drunks trying to forget the mess dealt to them in this hell they call home. The aroma of broth, boiled vegetables and seared meat relieves the stench of sour breath and half rotted teeth. Erevan, eyes peeled on each patron from a corner table, sharpens the broadheads on his finely fletched arrows with a wet stone nearly smooth. Maintenance, a discipline hammered repeatedly into his skull by a mentor he hasn't seen in ages. A sly smirk from the corner of his mouth forms as he hears the raspy voice in his head "Discipline is control, control is precision, precision is power". The smirk quickly fades and his lips curl in disdain as his next thoughts are the about the failure of the last guided hunt and the nobles who'd hired him—soft-handed, coward lords who'd vomit while he field dressed the beast he all but shot for them. They hang their trophies in their marble halls like conquests they themselves made, strutting beneath marvelous beasts sipping from crystal word more the the poor servings girls they would beat bloody after forcing themselves on them unable to perform with cocks as limp as their wills. The same silk-sheathed worms that destroyed his reputation after watching their hunting companion disemboweled, testicles to throat by the beast they'd paid him to take them to. "Should have let it take all of them" he whispers, testing the broadhead against his thumb until the blood wells up and pushes out through the flayed skin.

Erevan's sense sharpen and snap into the present as the sound of glass shatters from a quarrel fueled by liquid courage. The footwork of the men circling each other display a dire lack of skill. Both men towering just over five and a half foot. "A clash of the titans!" Erevan sarcastically says to himself as he continues to sharpen his broadheads.

He notices the waitress headed his way, carrying a steaming bowl of stew and a fresh pint of ale. His stomach aches and rumbles with hunger. A beautiful Half-Elf with dirty-blonde hair that falls just below her shoulders, dark brown eyes the shine with a hint of gold when the candle light hits just right. A soft smile perks up on her face as she notices Erevan looking at her.

"It's a rowdy crowd tonight" she says playfully as she set the bowl and tankard down.

"As long as it stay rowdy over there I shouldn't need you to protect me" Erevan says with sarcastic smirk.

The sound of tankard clashing in cheers rings out as the two titans finish their quarrel with a hug. "Ah, and I was worried over nothing" Erevan says again sarcastically. A smile beams across the waitress's face. She chuckles as she asks "What brings you to our peaceful town?" matching Erevan's sarcasm.

"I am a cobbler, I make shoes for the elite back in Caer Dusk, I need exotic supplies that I can only find on the border of Eldrathor in Cresgate" Erevan says with a stoic expression. His cautious demeanor peers through the sarcastic banter. It's his business, and he doesn't like others knowing his business.

The waitress, confused by his appearance glances back and forth, a double take on his clothing and gear. She doesn't know how to receive his story, but she thinks to herself "I know for sure he isn't a damn cobbler". "Oh, good luck finding what you need!" she says, understanding the pleasantries are no longer welcomed. He has a slight feeling of guilt. "She was just being nice" he says in his head. He isn't quiet sure what to make of this place. Hired to track down missing villagers, just outside of town, it's better to not let on to that. Anyone of these people in here could be a sick cunt, snatching unsuspecting people going about there business to take them somewhere and carve their sins into the reality of their victims. He's seen it before unfortunately.

"I'll be damned, at least I will have one last fine meal" as he shovels the stew into his mouth. "That old fuckers lessons always linger" Everan laughs to himself as he covers his tracks, that would lead wrong doers on a wild goose chase of winding, twisting, foot prints that circle the town.

Setting out before day break to get a jump on the mess he signed up for. Erevan pushes through the trees and into a clearing. In a brief pause, he wonders if his eyes deceive him. The valley before him doesn't blandly rot; it writhes in agony, vomiting forth a blight that covers the land. Blood-gorged parasites burrow through soil beneath him, black as a hanged man's tongue, each wriggling, body stuffed with liquefied human remains, each getting their fill on near by corpses. Their feculence spreads a plague of disease and pestilence that covers the land. As the rain begins to fall, the air turns thick, a layer stench that can only be described as sulfur hits his nostrils.

"Fuck me, even the rain is rotting in this land"

He continues forward, crossing streams clotted with a congealed thickness that resembles curdled milk. Ducking the bare limbs from trees that are blanched, dead from the acidic rain it would seem. The ground squelches and swells like a boil, a festering abscess that splits open under the pressure, spewing bile and methane into the atmosphere. Old men in Caer Dusk, with faces pinched and uptight, muttered over pints about the curse in the blood of the Eldrathor Kings. They said it was a punishment for pride, or perversion, or something that should remain unnamed. Erevan dismissed it as the foggy logic of the drunk and terrified. But now, seeing it for himself he understands why peasants would blame a princess born under a blood moon, especially after her birth claimed the life of the Queen. It is undeniable, Eldrathor is bleeding, hell Eldrathor is fucking dead.

The storms here haven't let up in weeks. Erevan's boots sink to the top of the kiltie in a spongy red and black surface, the color somewhere between dried blood and charred meat. The ground exhales a putrid stink like wound turned septic. His muscles contract and the blood expresses from within the stringy tethers of meat as he strains to wrench them free the clutching mud, glancing around for anything to help stabilize hit footing. Roots, collapsed trees, limbs, nothing around can offer support or stability; it's as if they all slither across the surface on their bellies, tangled and bare like the forest has given up hope. Overhead, the canopy should be a cathedral of lush greens, shading the ground from the summer sun, but what remain hang limp, the last desperate fiber holding to what once provided sustenance, their edges gnawed by some invisible blight. Branches slick with fungus, bark sloughing off in greasy strips, and every tree bore a crust of lichen that glowed faintly in the overcast light, like a rash spreading from trunk to trunk.

Silence, the only noise is the inconsistent drip of the acidic rain that gathers on Erevan's leather armor and the ringing pulse of his heart beat covered slighter by his exhales, pausing intervals to listen for any sign of motion. The warblers, the thrushes, the crows a whole orchestra of the usual woodland chorus are mute. If anything were to move here, it would be out of starvation or fear. The land itself seems to recoil.

A cool, uneasy breeze hit his face, the rain subsides after coating whatever remains. The aroma hits first, familiar, unmistakable. It takes but a moment for his eyes to locate the source. A missing villager, the first he's found, half-submerged in the congealed waters of the still creek bed. Wool garments green with mold, flesh liquefying and pooling beneath the corpse. Skin, hanging from the bone like wax melting away from the flame of a candle. The sharp tang of what belongs buried underground now festers in open air. "Poor soul has been here for weeks" Erevan, softly says under his breath.

Erevan crouches, holding an arrow like a maestro wielding a baton. With the tip he moves the tattered remnants of cloth away from the villager's face. Maggots writhe free with a faint squelching sound as they pour out in wet clumps from the sockets beneath eyes, yellowed, bulging, and glazed over in terror. The lips curled back in a rictus, a receding tongue twisted and contorting behind the newly exposed clenched teeth. His femurs, shattered and twisted at impossible angles, as the bones rip from skin, fractured and jagged. Below the ribs sat a single puncture, stark and surgical, as if something long and narrow had been driven through to maim and left to savor the agony. This display resembles something only a butcher would enjoy. Feeding on screams, engrossed with pleasure as he tortures his victim, manically laughing to a series of sickening pops, and wet squelches of tendons tearing from broken bones as limbs are drawn apart beyond its limits.

Beading on his brow, sweat gathers and runs down tracing the curves of his face. The trees groan, cackling under their own weight. Erevan's senses heighten, his breath stills, as his heart slows to an unnatural slow rhythm. Something is watching, patient and analytical, like a spider savoring its prey caught in a web. He doesn't flinch. After a moment the feeling subsides, he looks back at the mutilated corpse in front of him, Erevan has watched life fade from eye that he closed forever. But this butchery makes his stomach churn. This art, horrifically painted with blood and agony, this poor sap didn't realize he was the canvas. After studying this artist's handiwork Erevan knows his magnum opus of horror is yet to come.

With heightened senses, taut to the point of pain, he presses onward. The path narrows a cacophony dread, every step demanding a calculated decision: risk the sucking mud that bubbles beneath his feet, or brave the nettle-thick walls of briar and fungus that glisten with unnatural moisture. Erevan spots a tattered green cloak.

"Another one" he says to himself as if he's already pictured the scene he is about to witness. A once forest-colored but now mottled with black-brown stains, drapes the shredded and disfigured corpse. The garment matches the description of a farm boy—Terrin, they'd called him—who vanished from the same village three weeks prior. The body lies face down, split open from nape to tailbone, vertebrae gleaming like yellowed pearls in the dim light. His legs are twisted and pointing straight up toward the weeping sky, hips dislocated with surgical precision, torquing the femurs until they spiral behind him warping the leg around at impossible angles while stringy meat and translucent skin are the only tethers keeping the dismantled limbs attached to the torso. The head, cocked off to the side at a puppet-like angle, reveals eye sockets hollowed clean, replaced with smooth river rocks arranged with the meticulous care of a jeweler. On the exposed ribs, scrubbed white as winter bone, a spiral pattern scored with the point of a blade, shallow but unmistakable, perfect whorls tightening toward a center that rested on a thorny crown. Aligned precisely with where the heart would have been. A pulse of dread works its way up. The same pattern appears in a repeated dream throughout his life. An inevitable apocalypse, a prophecy of his own mutilation, with a feeling of immense failure swells over, know he did everything in his power to stop it. Erevan closes the boys' gapping jaws with an empathetic gentleness, then stood and scanned the woods.

Another hour passes as he moves in silence, following the line of the creek through a series of pools and slick-banked bends. With every hundred paces, the land grew more exhausted, the air so heavy with spores that the rag over his mouth clogs as he tries to avoid inhaling them. He listens for any sign of pursuit but hears nothing. This land is hollowed out, and he is its lone witness.

It's midday as he reaches a clearing, the light so diffuse and gray that time itself seems to hesitate. At the center stands a stone well, ancient and lidless, its rim crusted with moss and human skulls. Someone arranged the skulls in a ring around the mouth, their jaws agape in a useless cry. On the stones below, a series of tracks barefoot, splayed, inhuman like circled the well, then trailed off into the deeper woods. Fresh indents, sharp and clean, but filled already with a film of water. He glances into the well. The darkness inside was absolute. Peering throughout the ruins he finds a piece of cloth snagged on a bramble—a strip of sackcloth, stained with something dark and greasy, the scent familiar. Something in the fat, in the way it clings to the fibers, reminds him of tallow candles and ritual unguents from his childhood in the north.

He pockets the scrap and moves on. The prints led him toward a stand of dead birches, the bark peeled away in sheets, revealing pale wood beneath. There, at the edge of the dying wood, he caught the glint of metal: a child's toy, a small tin soldier, its head twisted off and its chest pierced by a thin wooden stake. The implication was too obvious to ignore. Erevan, getting a sense of the cold logic, sets the scene as it settles into his bones. This isn't the work of a creature gone mad. It is a hunt, and he is invited to witness its progress.

The tracks plunged deeper, serpentine through a stranglehold of thorns into a hollow where trees huddled like conspirators. Daylight bled away as the air chilled against his skin. Erevan measured each breath—an old mercenary's trick to mask fear beneath control. Around a bend in the path, he discovered another victim: an elderly woman suspended from a branch, her skin peeled away with methodical precision, her own intestines fashioned into the noose that held her aloft. Where eyes should have been, smooth river stones stared back at him. The display needed no translation: I want you to see what I've collected.

Dragging itself on the belly of the once beautiful forest the path is an ulcer of churned mud and blackened leaves that led inexorably toward the source of all this death. Erevan followed it with the grim focus of a man tracing a death sentence, eyes peeled for traps or the ghostly afterimage of whatever intellect had arranged the carnage behind him. For a while, the only sign of disturbance was the sickly-sweet odor thickening on the air, a cloying stench that reminded him uncomfortably of the paupers' wards in distant city mortuaries. But in time, even that was overwhelmed by a new presence: the prickle of heat, the metallic tang of fresh blood. Beneath it, the crackle of voices chanting in a tongue, older than the trees themselves. Terminating at the base of a crumbling escarpment, the ground yawned open into an uneven maw. The cave mouth was rimmed with a crust of old fat and something that might once have been hair, caked together by years of smoke and splatter. At its threshold, a pair of wooden dolls, their expressions depicting rapture and agony. Erevan, never superstitious, felt a momentary urge to leave an offering or mutter a prayer, but only spat to clear his throat and pressed onward.

Inside, the temperature drops with every step, light collapsing into a darkness so thick it drips from the ceiling. Air, thick with the scent of blood and burning flesh fills his nostrils. A syncopated chorus of guttural syllables, murmurs hanging in the air in anticipation echo down the narrow passage. Wicks burning short inside a slumping candle project shadows against weeping stalagmites and harden clay walls. A congregation of figures, each one hunched over like a bird of prey. Smoke gathers at the ceiling as embers radiate from within charred flesh, still crackling like seared meat. In the circle lay three smoldering bodies, aesthetically arranged in perfect symmetry. It takes but a glance at the prone bodies to reiterate what Erevan already knew.

"The missing children, all three of them" He thinks to himself in disgust. He sighs quietly. "A moment too late"

He slips through the shadows with an unbreakable focus. The need for parley or barter for the safe return no longer an option, the clarity of his purpose is absolute. The chamber throbs with dying chants that reverberate through his bones. Twelve silent steps bring him into their midst, a ghost unnoticed. Guttering yellow candles illuminate five skeletal figures kneeling in ritual. Thorned crowns rise from spirals carved with surgical precision into flesh. Blackened flakes of clotted blood and sticky wet chunks of tissue cling to the jagged edges of hollowed sockets, as if each cultist had torn out their own sight in ecstatic frenzy. Tendons, unmistakably human, seal their mouth with precise stitches, insinuating the work of a deranged artist. Their spines undulate back and forth in a hypnotic rhythm, being manipulated by invisible strings hanging from above.

Without a breath of sound, Erevan nocks an arrow. His fingers find the bowstring's worn groove, testament to his dedication to his craft. The goose feathered fletching softly brushes his cheek as he breathes deep and readies his shot, a familiar ritual that calms the storm in his chest. His eyes close, the breath leaves with a quiet sigh, eyes opening with an intense focus. A sharp snap echoes as he lets loose the bowstring.

He strikes with a predator's precision. A sharp snap echoes as he lets loose the bowstring. The arrow shrieks through the half-light, burying itself at the base of a woman's neck. A thwap rings out as the arrow punches through her neck bones, severs her brainstem and pushes through the soft layers of her esophagus before coming to a stop. Her arms flail, palms slapping the air and rocks beneath her as she reels from the shock, grasping for support to ease her pain. As her body slows you can hear the faintest as her lungs deflate around the finely crafted arrow still lodged in her punctured throat.

The fanatic to her left whirls around to square up with his predator, but it's too late for the unsuspecting prey. Erevan's left-hand clamps over the jaw, blood sprays from the once perfectly sewn lips now split open by a forceful twist. The fanatics jaw relents as a wet pop rings out from the joint bursting and rips free from the socket leaving his jaw hanging contorted, crooked and useless. With unbridled rage Erevan continues twisting, feeling every vertebra in the man's neck give way from the force. Twisting any further would remove head from mangled neck, no longer a threat Erevan's drops the limp body.

Another cultist lunges forward with muffled screams that give away his movements. Arms stretched out in a desperate attempt to locate their attacker. Erevan slips left, drawing steel from his hip in a single fluid motion. His blade arcs upward in a tight rising sweep the cleave frees the arms just below the elbow. Bone caps split, tendons retreating into the biceps like a whipped cord. In excruciating pain, the man's cries start from a muffle murmur to a blood curdling scream as the pain overwhelms him to the point he rips through the stitching in his lips in search of any relief. Erevan completes the pivot letting his momentum carry him in a tight pirouette that returns the strike scythed across the throat. Steel opening everything from the first layer of skin through the trachea before a sudden stop.

A split second later comes a sickening crunch as Erevan's heel slams into the fanatic's kneecap, ligaments snapping like mooring lines in a storm. The man buckles, and before he can even hit the dirt, Erevan's blade is already there to meet him. A dark red geyser erupts as the steel punches through the side of his neck, rupturing the carotid in a single, well-placed strike

Only one remains. Erevan slows his pace, letting the last fanatic's panic set in fully. It stumbles forward, the fanatic frantically flailing, fighting the feeling of fleeing. With a single, inexorable lunge, he drives his blade deep into her belly. Blood pours from her hands as she grasps the empaling blade. She begins to spasm uncontrollably. A deliberate twist of his wrist as he pulls back on the hilt, her ribs part, entrails spill out opening her viscera. Her breath quickens as she expects a fatal blow any second. It doesn't come. Erevan leaves her, crumpled and disfigured laying in her own feculent. Ensuring she suffers for as long as possible. If it were up to him, he would hire a healer to keep her alive long enough for the infection to set in and turn gangrenous. No, she doesn't get a sweet release. None of them should have.

His pulse roars in his ears. He wipes his stained hands on a length of coarse linen, blotting at the iron-scented smear until the cloth ran dark. Torches flickered in the stillness as he moves toward the chamber's center where the children lay in a circle, burnt motionless children. In the center of them stand a heavy copper bowl, its surface mottled with a thin rendered fat from the removed organs of the children.

The eldest girl of maybe twelve, described to have golden hair that fanned like a halo, now just charred remains, unable to recognize which one is which. The wound on her chest appears so careful, so deliberate, it reads in the same language as the rest, an artist's stroke. A single, clean incision, edges that didn't pucker or tear, a blade wielded by hands steadier than any of the twitching, emaciated cultists whose bodies now cooled on the stone floor. None of these fanatics carried the skill for these wounds, or the meticulous displays he had encountered in the forest—those grisly tableaux of peeled skin and positioned limbs spoke of patience and a disturbing aesthetic sensibility.

A chill comes over him. His spine stiffens as a cold weight settles between his shoulders. A subtle warm breath glides across his nape like a whisper. His knuckles crack as his grip tightens across the hilt of his blade. Frustration is let loose as grief and rage clash in his chest.

"Reveal yourself!" he yells. "Let only one of us leave this tomb and the other burn with the rest, a fitting end" he continued.

His blood cools. Looking down at the charred remains. "You all deserved better"

He let the grief weigh for a moment before he buries it deep. Exhales forcefully and gets back to his duty, to end suffering, not memorialize it as he releases the smallest child's cold hand. After stacking the bodies and memorizing the flesh carve sigils of the spiral and thorned crown, Erevan douses the bodies with oil from a nearby lamp. Flames from the torch whip and snap as he gives it one last look over. Erevan drops the torch and heads back out of the cave.

Still no color to be had in this grey land of decay, he walks until he loses sight of the cave. When all a sudden he is dropped to his knees, knuckles digging into the mud. The world tilts with ringing in his ears, and then, behind it, a sound. Chains rattle, gagged whimpers, bells ringing. With clarity that borders on hallucination, he sees a courtyard of red stained cobblestones. The same sounds echoing in the background, whimpers that seem to fade in wind. At the center was a platform, and atop it, a man kneeling, head bowed, arms bound behind his back, waiting for his life to be snuffed out. He blinks, and the vision shatters. The memory of that courtyard, the cave, the smell of burning flesh, the chains rattling and the muffled whimper sent a thrumming pain to the base of his skull.

Rising to his feet, Erevan steadies his breathing until the world stops tilting beneath him. A cold certainly settles in his bones like winter frost: these were not random cruelties. An architect had drawn the blueprint for both the ritual and his presence here. The spiral pulling him along, its curve inevitable as a noose tightening, he knows only death waits for him at the center.`

      'Maldan Breen plays wolf-in-silk among Caer Dusk’s elite—until a stranger’s spiral sigil fractures the game and forces a flight into the night.',
    status: 'published',
    content: `# A Mask for the Gutterborne

A chime from a flipped coin rang out, the bright, brief note swallowed by the thick velvet of the crowded chamber. Maldan Breen watched the coin tumble, glittering faintly in the light filled with smoke, before snatching it from the air, a gesture so practiced it may as well be a tic. He repeated the motion, letting the rhythm of metal and flesh steady his pulse as he studied his mark inside the tavern.

Braymon March, a senior treasurer of the Gilded Ledger, sat at the far end among a retinue of lesser merchants and decorative cousins. March was a man who announced his appetites in his every contour—his belly pressed against the table's edge, his cheeks pink and shiny as waxed apples, his thinning hair lacquered to his scalp in a futile campaign against the onslaught of age. He had the self-satisfaction of a man whose every failure was someone else's fault, and whose every indulgence was a just reward rather than a vice. Maldan could already see, in the way March fondled his painted snuff box and rolled his tongue over his teeth after every sweet, the precise pressure points that would shatter him.

But this was no ordinary game, no mere fleecing of some soft-palmed noble too foolish to know the stakes. The air in the room pulled with more than just the promise of gold. The other patrons at the table eyed one another with wary, appraising glances of predators forced to share a watering hole. A pair of city guardsmen, likely on March's retainer—leaned against the far wall, arms folded, faces impassive. The wine steward circled with a nervous energy that suggested he'd never served so many high-ranking gluttons in one evening. Even the chandelier seemed to tremble in anticipation, casting a thousand nervous shadows over the brocade and marble.

Once, Maldan would have drunk in these details with the hypervigilance of the hunted—listening for the shuffle of boots in the alley, memorizing the exits, tracing the pattern of the guards' patrols in his mind's eye. But tonight, he was the wolf in silk, and every wary eye was bent on someone else. He flicked the coin again, a little harder this time, and caught it on the back of his hand without looking. An old mentor had taught him the trick the winter he'd been conscribed as a lookout for the Kremont Brotherhood. "When you're scared, boy, let the coin do the talking. Sometimes you gotta' make your own luck" His luck sent him straight to the bottom of an unmarked grave, his body never found.

Maldan's gaze drifted from March to the crowd beyond—hawks and jackals dressed in velvet, their laughter competing with the music for volume. He'd spent years learning the dialect of the powerful, the precise ratio of self-deprecation and flattery needed to crack the shell of those who'd never known hunger. The memory of his first masquerade in these hallowed halls was never far: how the mask cut into his cheekbones, how the wine stung his empty stomach, how he'd mimicked their careless indolence until it grew into something like truth. He watched the way March laughed at the joke of a minor viscount, the way his eyes flicked to the door even as he clutched his waistline, a subtlety as bright as day to someone like Maldan.

The elites of Caer Dusk are lazy, overfed pride of peacocks blinded by luxury. Their hubris would never allow them to consider a predator prowled among them. Maldan Breen had survived decades in the streets by making them believe he belonged—practicing in the stifling warrens made of black bread and coal smoke—and by flipping a tarnished coin in his palm to steel his nerve. Every time he slipped into a candlelit salon with gilded wainscoting or breathed perfumed air through a noble's parlor, he ran through the old routines: mirror the drawl, slope the wrist, wear detachment like varnish. Never so perfectly they'd suspect, always a half-step shy of conviction. Laugh at yourself first, let them supply the punchline, and they'll trust you twice as fast with half as many questions.

Maldan's skillset allowed him to become whoever he wanted, whenever it was convenient for him. A skillset that will get you far in this town. Tonight, was special. A persona set in motion months in advance. Tonight, he was Marnet Cuirloch.

Marnet Cuirloch— now conveniently expired under a sewer flagstone—serving as Maldan's mask for the past seven nights among the Gilded Ledger's elite. The real Cuirloch had been Uvraine's envoy. Uvrainers were known for their lack of subtlety. Maldan honored this reputation by downing aquavit that burned his throat raw, chewing loudly on salt-crusted delicacies while twirling the ends of his singed mustache theatrically. His hair untamed, flowing, and dark, something he would have to get used to. His presence claiming space as he prowled the carpets as if he owned every inch, bellowing preposterous tales, playing the part like a seasoned actor. Maldan flipped his coin—a tarnished silver blessed by Maskaros, its edges worn thin by years of deceit. There was never a situation that he didn't touch with a bit of risk. He wove danger into the game like a thread, a game within a game.

Tonight, after spending the week infiltrating its ranks, The Gilded Ledger would become his opus. As he walks in the corner table sits the prize: Braymon March, a triple-chinned architect of ugly ducal bloodlines, drowning in gin while his Royal Audient hovered behind, gloved hands clasped, ears harvesting every whisper in the room. As Maldan enters his eyes dart around, sizing up every face, finding every exit, calculating angles. The rehearsed smile cutting through the crowd, you don't spend seventeen years perfecting the art of deception without learning that a properly timed smile can separate a man from more than his coin.

The day's work had been meticulous fingers dancing across twenty different household ledgers in the market quarter's back rooms, planting false deficits like seeds that would sprout blame by morning. Each falsified balance, each doctored entry positioned March's companions as the perfect scapegoats. Now came the culmination: the vault key that dangled from Braymon's belt chain, waiting to be liberated. A rehearsed act, the imperceptible transfer from belt to palm to sleeve. Heads meant charm, tails meant stealth, but either way, the key would change hands before the night was through.

Braymon's voice cracked through the smoky tavern, a booming, roguish laugh that skittered over tables and hearth light. He fixed Maldan with a grin wide as a canyon, from a table of empty dinner plates and tankards alike. Craving friendship and camaraderie with Maldan so fiercely his voice trembled. But Maldan's gaze was a dark jewel, held in calculated repose, reflecting only the faintest spark of warmth. Braymon thundered, "Marnet! Come here, you bastard!" and Maldan merely inclined his head, an actor stepping onto a stage he alone had written.

Braymon lunged into questions, his tone gallant with concern. "I never thought we'd see you tonight—what of your negotiations, the morning's work?" His eyes glittered, unknowing of the razor concealed beneath the manufactured comradery. Maldan's lips curved in rehearsed ease. "Work can rot and fade into lasting memories! One last night of revelry, yes?" He raised his cup, every syllable a silken lie. The chant of pipe and lute swelled as Braymon waved him to the nearest bench, dismissing the company he was keeping. With each cup Braymon drained, Maldan's single goblet remained untouched, its surface like a black mirror.

Under flickering torchlight, Braymon's cheeks deepened to bruised red, his speech mellowing to honeyed staves. Maldan watched every falter of his new friend's tongue, every glass poured by eager servers, as pieces sliding into place. A slow, deliberate shift forward, and Maldan produced his coin: an heirloom, cold, but comforting. It danced from thumb to forefinger—an omen of risk to come. Then, out of the corner of his vision, he sees her: a figure draped in shadow, her pupils glinting with dreadful certainty, a sigil on her forehead meticulously carved, like an artist sculpting a monument. A perfectly symmetrical spiral, with a tarnished crown wrapped in thorns sits atop. Her lips curved in that mocking, knowing smile— "You're found, thief. Your gambit ends here."

Maldan's breath hitched. The coin escaped him, spinning, and his stomach knotted; he hadn't dropped it in twenty winters. He lunged, seized it, but when he glanced back the stranger had melted into the smoke. Panic flayed his mind: who was she? What doom awaited him? Braymon's drunken roar thundered past his dread: "Always flipping that damn coin! But never losing your nerve, eh?" The moment cracked like ice. Maldan lurches to his feet, eyes raking the shadows for the cloaked figure. "Excuse me," he mutters, already shoving past bodies that blur into obstacles. The smoke-choked chamber swallows his breath as he plunges through the kitchens where grease sizzles and curses fly. A serving girl screams as he knocks her tray skyward, amber liquid raining down as he crashes outside.

The alley beyond stinks of rotting waste, decomposing carcasses from the night’s dinner left out for the strays and the desperate. He darts down a narrow channel, flipping into shadows and cutting over blind stairwells. Behind him, the echo of boots: Reavers, no doubt, certain of the murder he didn't commit. As he whispered to Maskaros the world blurred, footsteps rattled off the walls behind him, and false echoes spilled into the street. He slipped through a stone arch, darkness swallowing him, carrying only the memory of a Braymon's gargled pleas and the sigil on the forehead of the stranger whos blade disrupted the perfect game.

There is no sound now, no commotion or scuttle. Just the silence falling over a now foggy night. The streets are emptied, no doubt the Reavers doing. Clearing them out checking anyone who they deemed suspicious. Maldan takes a step forward, out of the darkness that protected him. He places his feet with intent, every step deliberate, not making a sound as he works his way to an abandoned house in the lower ward. A place he knows all too well, the only place he knows will be truly safe for the night.

Huddled in the corner he fights the oncoming sleep. Replaying the nights events repeatedly in his head. The blood still smeared across his face and the clothes borrowed from the Uvraine who no longer needed them. 'A gift for the part' he thought.

Pain lances through Maldan's skull as exhaustion finally claims him. His eyes snap open to blood-stained cobblestones stretching beneath his feet, a permanent witness to a horrific slaughter. Cathedral bells toll, disorienting him despite years of navigating unfamiliar cities. The clanking of chains reverberates inside his skull, followed by muffled whimpering that hooks into his conscience. Before him, a condemned man kneels at a block darkened by countless executions, tears carving clean tracks down his filthy cheeks. A cleric's proclamation booms across the courtyard, words indistinct yet somehow final. The executioner raises his axe. It falls. The crowd exhales as one.

Maldan jolts awake on the floor, gulping air like a drowning man. Braymon's dried blood still crusts his hands, the vault key cold between his fingers. "The vault will be watched," he whispers, "no matter when I go." The dream pulses behind his eyes, but one detail burns clearest—the executioner's axe pommel bearing a spiral sigil crowned with thorns. "Fuck me, Halvar's Grace?" He mutters in disbelief.

Darkness remains over the streets as he retrieves an emergency pack that he placed. An old habit, taught to him by a mentor lost to time. "Someone destroyed me, I need to know who." Before dawn breaks, Maldan slips from Caer Dusk, likely forever, bound for a city where tricksters like him face the headsman's blade. Somehow, it's the only path forward.`

      'Titus Granitefist carries a legacy of diamond-hard faith into a borderland of slaughter—where corrupted visions and a bone-winged blasphemy await.',

    content: `# Ancestral Bonds

Word of The Cleansing—a raw slaughter of impossible violence—always arrived late in these borderlands, carried over mud and slush by wayfarers with frostbitten faces and cudgels for arms. But for Titus Granitefist, last of his line, whose veins ran thick with the same ambrosial fire that once burned in the marrow of Titan Granitefist, the news struck deep within him, rattling his very core and awakens his Ancestral Spirit. His wounds from the eastern pass—festering and stitched, but never quite healed—seethed as if in answer, a phantom ache to remind him that pain was the only true inheritance.

Hunched over a jug of foul cider in a nameless tavern just beyond the Thaldrenne border, cursing the absent gods, the King, and the empty air in equal measure. His skin, hard and prismatic as diamond, shimmered in candlelight. It was a thing to admire, but Titus understood it for what it was: an oath, a monument to a forebear's martyrdom that he carries, a mark forever loyal to Lathander, the Morninglord. The barkeep, a jaundiced woman with more kindness than the world deserved, served him as he nursed the wound covered in blackened bandages on his thigh and tracing the latticed scars that ran from the base of his neck to his hip.

Bitter silence became his only comfort—a choking quiet punctured by brawls and screams from the alley. Yet the gaunt, stooped folk of Thaldrenne possessed that peculiar instinct of the desperate: they recognized in his diamond-hard skin and inhuman features a ward against encroaching shadows. They gathered around him, offering their burdens like unwanted gifts. His days, filled with mending broken fences, splinting fractured bones, dragging bewitched cattle from frost-rimmed crevasses, anything he could do to help the people across Thaldrenne. After a long day when darkness fell, his voice would rise, spinning tales of Titan Granitefist—how his forefather had stared into oblivion's maw and emerged transformed, ascending beyond mortality. Ancient legends passed through bloodlines like heirlooms, now rendered fantastical in a world where gods no longer walked.

Titus told himself that aiding the suffering folk of Thaldrenne was purpose enough. One diamond-skinned man against the King's Penitent Legions would accomplish nothing but his own death. Yet rage festered in him like an abscess that would not drain. Each time those crimson banners appeared on the horizon, winding through mist-heavy fields, his fists clenched until his knuckles ached. The suffering here was deliberate—a calculated system of misery engineered by men with hearts as cold as the northern wastes.

He was just one man. This truth he accepted. And still.

After his night of drinking having left his mouth tasting of salt and sourness, carrion birds circled overhead as he fumbled through prayers he'd learned as a child—forbidden invocations to Lathander, the Morninglord who once promised dawn after every darkness. Falling to his knees the ancient words spilled from him in broken rhythms, each syllable falling into the silence without echo or answer.

"Deaf gods or dead gods—what's the difference?" he spat, pushing himself upright.

He limped back to his rented room, a space so cramped his shield leaned against the foot of his bed. Fresh blood seeped through the bandages on his thigh, collecting in crimson pools on the floorboards. Gritting his teeth against a pain that cut through his drunken haze, he tore open his pack for supplies. His fingers worked methodically, cleaning and binding the wound while his mind drifted toward blessed emptiness.

That night, the dreams came—sharper than memory, more insistent than the clamor of his waking life. He was standing in the center of a vast, sunless courtyard, its stones slick with something that glistened like pitch but reeked of rot. The air was thick, choked with the stench of burned hair and unwashed bodies. Above him, the sky spun in a slow, unnatural spiral, as if the dome of the heavens had been yanked askew by a child's tantrum.

Around the edges of the courtyard, faceless figures in bloodstained tabards dragged the broken, the sick, the old, and the mad into neat rows. There was no efficiency—just a rote, mechanical cruelty, the kind that was sanctioned by a king or god. In the center, a raised platform. On it, a single man, naked but for a hood of sodden cloth, knelt before a block of black stone. Behind him a figured in a black hooded cloak, his axe raised high in the air.

Titus recognized the sigil on the executioner's pommel: the sunburst of Lathander, corrupted into a spiral, tightly woven with a tarnish crown covered in golden metal thorns. The blade came down, and as it did, the air filled with a sound Titus had never heard before. Gagged whimpers drown out by rattling chains in a rhythmic suffering.

He woke with a start, the echo of the chains and cries reverberating through the cramped, smoke-choked upper room of the tavern. He had bitten through his own tongue in the night; the taste of blood was real, as was the dull throbbing in his chest. He spent the morning staring at the fire and refusing all entreaties from the townsfolk. When, at last, he dragged himself from next to the fire and staggered outside, he found the world unchanged: cold, gray, and indifferent. He had expected something more—a sign, perhaps—but instead, he was met by the same field of frostbitten mud, the same distant banners, the same hollowed-out faces.

Perhaps, he reasoned, the dream had been nothing more than a grotesque burlesque conjured by his fevered mind. Perhaps he was finally losing himself to the rot.

It was two days before he heard the first reports. A ragged merchant crashed through the tavern door, collapsing to his knees. His eyes bulged white with terror, blood vessels burst across the whites. "FRADINE!" he screamed, spittle flying. His pack hit the floor with a thud that silenced the room. "Something tore through the sky above us—" His words choked off as he retched bile onto the floorboards. "Not star. Not bird. A MAN WITH NO FLESH!" His body convulsed. "Wings like—like death stripped naked. BONE WINGS SCRAPING THE CLOUDS!" He clawed at his own face until crimson streaks appeared, then crumpled into a sobbing heap.

Titus's blood ignited. The ancestral fire that had slaughtered legions of demons centuries ago roared through his diamond-hard veins. He seized his Warhammer, the oilcloth wrapping tearing as he yanked it free—and slung his battle-scarred shield across his back with such force the leather straps groaned. Without a word to anyone, he stormed into the freezing sleet, each footfall cracking the frozen earth beneath.

The path to Fradine was a gallery of nightmares. Blackened husks of homes still smoldered despite the sleet. A child's doll lay face-down in a puddle of frozen blood. The few living children, thinning, bones protruding beneath stretched skin, with eyes like empty wells—stared at him from shadows, too ravaged by hunger to flee from his towering form. In the center of one razed hamlet, Titus halted before a woman's severed head impaled on a splintered fencepost. Her skull had been repeatedly smashed until brain matter oozed down the wood like obscene candle wax.

"FUCKING TITHE REAPERS!" Titus roared, his diamond skin fracturing the air around him as his rage exploded. "I'LL BUTCHER EVERY LAST ONE OF YOU, CUNT BASTARDS!" He shouts, slamming his fist against the post.

It was nearing dusk on the third day when he reached the outskirts of Fradine. The village was less a settlement than a scar—a ring of mud hovels and slumped barns, girdled by a ditch half-filled with old snow and, in places, older blood. The people here stared from behind shuttered windows, not even venturing outside to gawk at the newcomer.

Titus knew this silence. It was the same suffocating quiet that had preceded every massacre he'd witnessed—the held breath before the scream. His boots squelched through the half-frozen muck as he moved deeper into the village, shield shifting against his back with each step. The stench hit him first: not the usual reek of poverty and livestock, but something else underneath. Sweet rot. The kind that crawled up your nostrils and nested there.

The market square stretched before him, abandoned save for overturned carts and scattered grain that had begun to sprout in the mud, fed by something darker than rainwater. At the center, the well's bucket hung askew, its rope severed clean through. Dark stains splattered the stones around it in patterns that made his stomach clench—not random violence, but deliberate, made from suffering.

His diamond skin prickled, that ancient warning singing through his blood. The air grew thick, pressing against his lungs like wet wool. Above, the clouds churned in that same unnatural spiral from his dream, tightening, darkening, until the dying light took on the quality of old brass.

Then he heard it—wet breathing from behind the granary. Not human. Too deep, too many lungs working at once. His hand found the hammer's grip, leather worn smooth by generations of Granitefist warriors. The weight of it steadied him as he rounded the corner.

The thing that had once been celestial hung suspended three feet above the ground, its body a blasphemy against creation itself. The air around it didn't just move—it convulsed violently, reality spasming in revulsion. Titus's arm hair ripped upward so sharply he felt follicles tear. Where wings should have spread in glory, bone frameworks jutted like broken torture implements, draped with membrane that wept putrid fluids with each violent spasm. A symbol carved into is mutilated figure, a winding spiral, beneath a crown covered in thorns. The temperature plummets so savagely that his breath crystallized mid-exhale, the moisture in his eyes beginning to freeze. Its flesh wasn't just decayed—it was actively decomposing before him, splitting open at the joints revealing absolute darkness within, devouring any illumination around it.

It snapped toward him with a sound that shattered sanity: ten thousand voices obliterate simultaneously, each fragment scraping against bone. Its neck wrenched with such violence that vertebrae exploded through skin in a spray of black ichor that sizzled where it struck the ground. When it spoke, voices erupted from its gaping maw, overlapping, fighting each other for dominance—shrieks that made his eardrums bulge and bass tones that rattled his bowels inside him.

"Another heir of the false light," it shrieked. Its jaw unhinged with a wet, fibrous crack—tendon snapping, bone grinding—until the maw gaped far wider than anything living should manage. Each syllable spat out ropes of black corruption that clung between its splintered jaw and its pulsing chest, quivering like severed worms searching for meat, its empty sockets leaking threads of putrefaction down the contours of its skull.

"Your ancestor's god is severed," it hissed. "Your prayers are nothing—just the lonely masturbation of a dead and meaningless faith."

Titus roared in defiance, swinging his hammer in a wide arc, aiming to crush the creature where it stood. But it seemed to shift through space, reappearing beside him in an instant. Its putrid hand clamped onto Titus's shoulder, sending waves of numbing cold racing through his body. Cold bled through his armor before the thing even touched him. When its hand finally closed on his shoulder, the pain was blinding: a spike of frost that plunged into bone and sent his muscles seizing in revolt. His vision blurred at the edges. The echoing voices of memories not of his own whispered nonsense in the back of his skull.

Titus tore himself free with a snarling rage, swinging his Warhammer in a brutal, survival driven arc, puncturing the creature's ribcage, folding its torso inward with a series of cracking pops, yet it didn't recoil. It simply bent around the blow before snapping back into shape, its chest still caving inward in places, bones writhing beneath the skin like trapped serpents.

It lurched toward him, its face inches from his. "When Velka returns," it rasped, voices tangling like discordant strings, "your bloodline will wither and die. Your ancestors will scream in the void for eternity."

The proclamation drilled into Titus's mind, each syllable resonating through his skull. His fingers tightened around the hammer's haft until the leather grip creaked. "Is that so?" he growled through clenched teeth, "Well then, lets not keep them waiting".`
