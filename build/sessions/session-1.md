## 1. The Meeting at Execution Square

The party convened in **Halvar's Grace** at Execution Square. Following a shared lucid vision where they saw one another amidst the blood and stone, they decided to band together. As they departed for **The Woeful Toad**, they noticed they were being tailed.

### The Nervous Watcher

Upon confrontation, the stalker revealed himself to be **Destrian Cornwallis**, a nervous corpse tender who despises his job but has no family left following _“The Cleansing.”_ He admitted to following the group because he noticed their visceral reaction in the square and knew they also heard the phantom chains.

### The Chute

**Destrian** led the party to a refuse chute near the church. He nodded toward it before retreating to his duties, fearful of being seen with outsiders.

- **Investigation:** **Titus Granitefist** cast a spell to detect celestials and confirmed a divine presence near the chute where bodies are dumped.
- **The Drop:** Upon opening the chute, the group heard audible chains and gagged whimpers. **Maldan Breen** cast _Light_ on a copper coin and dropped it. It fell approximately 200 feet before the chute curved out of sight beneath the church. Finding no other external clues, the group proceeded to the tavern.

## 2. The Woeful Toad

At the tavern, the party sought rest and information. **Titus** spoke with the proprietor, **Tilla Bramblebrew**.

- **Social Encounter:** **Titus** used his persuasion skills effectively. **Tilla** became quite fond of him and gifted him a bottle of “unsold” whiskey.
  
  _Item Acquired: Old Whiskey (+4 Temporary HP)._ 
- **Scouting:** Meanwhile, **Erevan**—maintaining his cautious ranger nature—scouted the perimeter. Once deemed safe, he joined the group inside.
- **The Performance:** **Dazrian Edgecorde** decided to grace the crowd with a song. It impressed **Tilla** so much that she asked him to come back and play that night as they were expecting a crowd, offering room and board in exchange.

## 3. Clues from Ruphus Kess

While **Maldan Breen** settled in a corner with an ale, he noticed a patron, **Ruphus Kess**, reacting viscerally to something Titus said at the bar.

**Maldan** approached **Ruphus** and successfully cast _Charm Person_.

**Intel:** **Ruphus** opened up about his PTSD and past dealings. Once a commander of the 5th Penitent Legion, unable to commit atrocities he was forcefully removed from his position. Now, a shell of himself and a drunk, he revealed that **Arathus Kexor**, a priest at the church, once tried to coerce him into a tunnel beneath the church. **Ruphus** had refused, as he wanted nothing to do with the strange priest.

## 4. The Investigation of Arathus

Armed with this new link, the party returned to the church to track down the priest.

They met **Brother Jareth**, who informed them that **Arathus** has been missing for some time. Previous church investigations yielded nothing. **Jareth** provided directions to **Arathus's** dwelling: outside of town, up the low roads on the left.

## 5. Arathus's House & The Cult

The group located the house, which was in surprisingly good condition for belonging to a missing person.

- **The Illusion:** After knocking, the door creaked open. The group detected magic in the area, revealing an illusion covering the floor. Behind it, they found a stairway carved into the ground leading to a dark hallway.
- **The Ambush:** **Erevan** sneaked down to investigate and heard murmurs and chanting.
- **Combat:** A noise triggered an attack. **Arathus** summoned a **Spined Devil** from the body of one of the cultists, initiating a desperate fight.

## 6. Aftermath

The party successfully dismantled the cultist group and killed **Arathus**.

- **Final Words:** **Arathus’s** dying words were: _“It's all for the heir.”_
- **Loot:** The group received 212 gp, a sigil, and a mysterious _Bone Key_.
