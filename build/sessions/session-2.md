## I. The Ashes of Arathus

The cultist **Arathus Kexor** lay dead. Among his possessions, the party recovered **212 gp**, a jagged _Bone Key_, and a heavy iron sigil belonging to the **Umbral Reavers**.

While the group consolidated their findings, **Maldan Breen** discovered a series of glyphs scrawled on the wall. The symbols triggered a deep, personal recognition within him. Visibly shaken, he apologized to the party, stating he had to pursue this lead immediately at the city archives. He promised to rendezvous in two days and departed with haste.

### The Witnesses

**Erevan**, utilizing his bond with nature, spoke to the only witnesses left alive: two goats named **Billy and Billy**. Through their skittish bleating, a horrific truth was revealed:

> “The Master spoke the words. The man… he didn't change right. Arathus threw him away. But the female… her bones snapped and grew. Her fingers became knives. She clawed out her own eyes and peeled the skin from her ribs. Arathus told her ‘Go now child and await the Mother's call.’”

To cover their tracks and cleanse the site, the party set the house ablaze, informing the gate guards of a “tragic fire” as they returned to the city.

## II. Shadows in the Woeful Toad

The party returned to **The Woeful Toad** at dusk. **Tilla Bramblebrew** welcomed them warmly, offering **Dazrian Edgecorde** a drink and a surge of inspiration. Dazrian took the stage, weaving illusions of a seductive demoness into his performance, holding the crowd in the palm of his hand.

### The Reaver's Grief

Outside, **Erevan** was approached by **Thalia Greycut**. She warned him that his companions were too loud for a city ruled by silence. Recognizing the sigil on her belt, Erevan presented the bloodied amulet found on Arathus.

Thalia was devastated. She confirmed the sigil belonged to **Vane**, a missing agent. Erevan explained Vane's fate—sacrificed to become a devil—and the mutation of his partner, **Mira**. Thalia revealed her true allegiance: she belonged to the **Umbral Reavers**, a shadow guild dedicated to hunting monstrosities that breached the realm from the **Grey Lament**. She begged the party: if they find Mira, end her suffering.

## III. The Iron Dowager

Inside, **Titus Granitefist** spotted a noblewoman and a younger man watching Dazrian with keen interest. Through a loud (and slightly awkward) introduction, the party was invited to their booth.

The young man, **Corwin Balor**, was merely a mouthpiece. The true power was his wife, **Lady Isilde Balor**. She revealed a wanted poster of **Dazrian**, issued by **House Thane** for the murder of **Ser Daven Thane**. She knew Dazrian was the bard in question.

> “House Thane took everything from me. My husband, my brother, my lands. They are the King's jackals. I want them bled.”

**The Heist:** Lady Isilde offered the party protection at her estate. In exchange, she asked that they raid the **Thane Warehouse** to steal a **Black Ledger** containing proof of the House's illegal dealings. The party accepted, seeking refuge from the exposed tavern.

## IV. The Horror at the Farm

After a night of rest at the Balor Estate (and a successful romantic conquest by **Titus** involving Tilla), the party mobilized. Before attempting the heist, they decided to tie up the loose end at the farm, suspecting the creature eating livestock was the mutated Reaver, **Mira**.

At the farm, they met the obstinate farmer **Eddy Ric Voss** and, surprisingly, the goats Billy and Billy, who had wandered there. **Erevan** befriended a sheep that was sad for not being named, naming him **Tav**. The relieved sheep directed them toward the woods.

### The Mercy Kill

Stalking through the rain-soaked forest, the party ambushed the creature. **Mira** was a nightmare of weeping flesh and elongated limbs—a being **Riven** by the Grey Lament. She flew at Erevan, grappling him in a desperate embrace, but the combined might of the party ended her misery quickly.

They took the creature's head—proof for the farmer, and closure for the Reavers.
