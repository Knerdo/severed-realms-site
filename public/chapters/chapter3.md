Word of The Cleansing-a raw slaughter of impossible violence-always arrived late in these borderlands, carried over mud and slush by wayfarers with frostbitten faces and cudgels for arms. But for Titus Granitefist, last of his line, whose veins ran thick with the same ambrosial fire that once burned in the marrow of Titan Granitefist, the news struck deep within him, rattling his very core and awakens his Ancestral Spirit. His wounds from the eastern pass-festering and stitched, but never quite healed-seethed as if in answer, a phantom ache to remind him that pain was the only true inheritance.

Hunched over a jug of foul cider in a nameless tavern just beyond the Thaldrenne border, cursing the absent gods, the King, and the empty air in equal measure. His skin, hard and prismatic as diamond, shimmered in candlelight. It was a thing to admire, but Titus understood it for what it was: an oath, a monument to a forebear's martyrdom that he carries, a mark forever loyal to Lathander, the Morninglord. The barkeep, a jaundiced woman with more kindness than the world deserved, served him as he nursed the wound covered in blackened bandages on his thigh and tracing the latticed scars that ran from the base of his neck to his hip.

Bitter silence became his only comfort-a choking quiet punctured by brawls and screams from the alley. Yet the gaunt, stooped folk of Thaldrenne possessed that peculiar instinct of the desperate: they recognized in his diamond-hard skin and inhuman features a ward against encroaching shadows. They gathered around him, offering their burdens like unwanted gifts. His days, filled with mending broken fences, splinting fractured bones, dragging bewitched cattle from frost-rimmed crevasses, anything he could do to help the people across Thaldrenne. After a long day when darkness fell, his voice would rise, spinning tales of Titan Granitefist-how his forefather had stared into oblivion's maw and emerged transformed, ascending beyond mortality. Ancient legends passed through bloodlines like heirlooms, now rendered fantastical in a world where gods no longer walked.

Titus told himself that aiding the suffering folk of Thaldrenne was purpose enough. One diamond-skinned man against the King's Penitent Legions would accomplish nothing but his own death. Yet rage festered in him like an abscess that would not drain. Each time those crimson banners appeared on the horizon, winding through mist-heavy fields, his fists clenched until his knuckles ached. The suffering here was deliberate-a calculated system of misery engineered by men with hearts as cold as the northern wastes.

He was just one man. This truth he accepted.  
<br/>And still.

After his night of drinking having left his mouth tasting of salt and sourness, carrion birds circled overhead as he fumbled through prayers he'd learned as a child-forbidden invocations to Lathander, the Morninglord who once promised dawn after every darkness. Falling to his knees the ancient words spilled from him in broken rhythms, each syllable falling into the silence without echo or answer.

"Deaf gods or dead gods-what's the difference?" he spat, pushing himself upright.

He limped back to his rented room, a space so cramped his shield leaned against the foot of his bed. Fresh blood seeped through the bandages on his thigh, collecting in crimson pools on the floorboards. Gritting his teeth against a pain that cut through his drunken haze, he tore open his pack for supplies. His fingers worked methodically, cleaning and binding the wound while his mind drifted toward blessed emptiness.

That night, the dreams came-sharper than memory, more insistent than the clamor of his waking life.

He was standing in the center of a vast, sunless courtyard, its stones slick with something that glistened like pitch but reeked of rot. The air was thick, choked with the stench of burned hair and unwashed bodies. Above him, the sky spun in a slow, unnatural spiral, as if the dome of the heavens had been yanked askew by a child's tantrum.

Around the edges of the courtyard, faceless figures in bloodstained tabards dragged the broken, the sick, the old, and the mad into neat rows. There was no efficiency-just a rote, mechanical cruelty, the kind that was sanctioned by a king or god. In the center, a raised platform. On it, a single man, naked but for a hood of sodden cloth, knelt before a block of black stone. Behind him a figured in a black hooded cloak, his axe raised high in the air.

Titus recognized the sigil on the executioner's pommel: the sunburst of Lathander, corrupted into a spiral, tightly woven with a tarnish crown covered in golden metal thorns. The blade came down, and as it did, the air filled with a sound Titus had never heard before. Gagged whimpers drown out by rattling chains in a rhythmic suffering.

He woke with a start, the echo of the chains and cries reverberating through the cramped, smoke-choked upper room of the tavern. He had bitten through his own tongue in the night; the taste of blood was real, as was the dull throbbing in his chest.

He spent the morning staring at the fire and refusing all entreaties from the townsfolk. When, at last, he dragged himself from next to the fire and staggered outside, he found the world unchanged: cold, gray, and indifferent. He had expected something more-a sign, perhaps-but instead, he was met by the same field of frostbitten mud, the same distant banners, the same hollowed-out faces.

Perhaps, he reasoned, the dream had been nothing more than a grotesque burlesque conjured by his fevered mind. Perhaps he was finally losing himself to the rot.

It was two days before he heard the first reports.

A ragged merchant crashed through the tavern door, collapsing to his knees. His eyes bulged white with terror, blood vessels burst across the whites.

"FRADINE!" he screamed, spittle flying. His pack hit the floor with a thud that silenced the room.

"Something tore through the sky above us-" His words choked off as he retched bile onto the floorboards.

"Not star. Not bird. A MAN WITH NO FLESH!" His body convulsed.

"Wings like-like death stripped naked. BONE WINGS SCRAPING THE CLOUDS!" He clawed at his own face until crimson streaks appeared, then crumpled into a sobbing heap.

Titus's blood ignited. The ancestral fire that had slaughtered legions of demons centuries ago roared through his diamond-hard veins. He seized his Warhammer, the oilcloth wrapping tearing as he yanked it free-and slung his battle-scarred shield across his back with such force the leather straps groaned. Without a word to anyone, he stormed into the freezing sleet, each footfall cracking the frozen earth beneath.

The path to Fradine was a gallery of nightmares. Blackened husks of homes still smoldered despite the sleet. A child's doll lay face-down in a puddle of frozen blood. The few living children, thinning, bones protruding beneath stretched skin, with eyes like empty wells-stared at him from shadows, too ravaged by hunger to flee from his towering form. In the center of one razed hamlet, Titus halted before a woman's severed head impaled on a splintered fencepost. Her skull had been repeatedly smashed until brain matter oozed down the wood like obscene candle wax.

"FUCKING TITHE REAPERS!" Titus roared, his diamond skin fracturing the air around him as his rage exploded.

"I'LL BUTCHER EVERY LAST ONE OF YOU, CUNT BASTARDS!" He shouts, slamming his fist against the post.

It was nearing dusk on the third day when he reached the outskirts of Fradine. The village was less a settlement than a scar-a ring of mud hovels and slumped barns, girdled by a ditch half-filled with old snow and, in places, older blood. The people here stared from behind shuttered windows, not even venturing outside to gawk at the newcomer.

Titus knew this silence. It was the same suffocating quiet that had preceded every massacre he'd witnessed-the held breath before the scream. His boots squelched through the half-frozen muck as he moved deeper into the village, shield shifting against his back with each step. The stench hit him first: not the usual reek of poverty and livestock, but something else underneath. Sweet rot. The kind that crawled up your nostrils and nested there.

The market square stretched before him, abandoned save for overturned carts and scattered grain that had begun to sprout in the mud, fed by something darker than rainwater. At the center, the well's bucket hung askew, its rope severed clean through. Dark stains splattered the stones around it in patterns that made his stomach clench-not random violence, but deliberate, made from suffering.

His diamond skin prickled, that ancient warning singing through his blood. The air grew thick, pressing against his lungs like wet wool. Above, the clouds churned in that same unnatural spiral from his dream, tightening, darkening, until the dying light took on the quality of old brass.

Then he heard it-wet breathing from behind the granary. Not human. Too deep, too many lungs working at once. His hand found the hammer's grip, leather worn smooth by generations of Granitefist warriors. The weight of it steadied him as he rounded the corner.

The thing that had once been celestial hung suspended three feet above the ground, its body a blasphemy against creation itself. The air around it didn't just move-it convulsed violently, reality spasming in revulsion. Titus's arm hair ripped upward so sharply he felt follicles tear. Where wings should have spread in glory, bone frameworks jutted like broken torture implements, draped with membrane that wept putrid fluids with each violent spasm. A symbol carved into is mutilated figure, a winding spiral, beneath a crown covered in thorns. The temperature plummets so savagely that his breath crystallized mid-exhale, the moisture in his eyes beginning to freeze. Its flesh wasn't just decayed-it was actively decomposing before him, splitting open at the joints revealing absolute darkness within, devouring any illumination around it.

It snapped toward him with a sound that shattered sanity: ten thousand voices obliterate simultaneously, each fragment scraping against bone. Its neck wrenched with such violence that vertebrae exploded through skin in a spray of black ichor that sizzled where it struck the ground. When it spoke, voices erupted from its gaping maw, overlapping, fighting each other for dominance-shrieks that made his eardrums bulge and bass tones that rattled his bowels inside him.

"Another heir of the false light," it shrieked. Its jaw unhinged with a wet, fibrous crack-tendon snapping, bone grinding-until the maw gaped far wider than anything living should manage. Each syllable spat out ropes of black corruption that clung between its splintered jaw and its pulsing chest, quivering like severed worms searching for meat, its empty sockets leaking threads of putrefaction down the contours of its skull.

"Your ancestor's god is severed," it hissed. "Your prayers are nothing-just the lonely masturbation of a dead and meaningless faith."

Titus roared in defiance, swinging his hammer in a wide arc, aiming to crush the creature where it stood. But it seemed to shift through space, reappearing beside him in an instant. Its putrid hand clamped onto Titus's shoulder, sending waves of numbing cold racing through his body.

Cold bled through his armor before the thing even touched him. When its hand finally closed on his shoulder, the pain was blinding: a spike of frost that plunged into bone and sent his muscles seizing in revolt. His vision blurred at the edges. The echoing voices of memories not of his own whispered nonsense in the back of his skull.

Titus tore himself free with a snarling rage, swinging his Warhammer in a brutal, survival driven arc, puncturing the creature's ribcage, folding its torso inward with a series of cracking pops, yet it didn't recoil. It simply bent around the blow before snapping back into shape, its chest still caving inward in places, bones writhing beneath the skin like trapped serpents.

It lurched toward him, its face inches from his. "When Velka returns," it rasped, voices tangling like discordant strings, "your bloodline will wither and die. Your ancestors will scream in the void for eternity."

The proclamation drilled into Titus's mind, each syllable resonating through his skull.

His fingers tightened around the hammer's haft until the leather grip creaked. "Is that so?" he growled through clenched teeth, "Well then, lets not keep them waiting".

He unleashed another strike, the hammer's head tearing through the frigid air with all his fury behind it. Metal met corrupted bone with a hollow crack, splitting the abomination into fragmented shadows that immediately coalesced behind him, its decaying fingers tracing his nape with horrific purpose, piercing his skull. Bleeding poison into his thoughts.

Reality fractured around Titus as his mind bends, the boundary between waking world and nightmare splintering like jagged seams of shattered glass, revealing glimpses of the Grey Lament seeping through Terevas's weakening barriers.

The celestial's teeth clicked inches from his ear. "Let me show you what your ancestors begged to forget."

"Show me then, you repugnant fiend!" Titus roared in defiance, driving his hammer backward with the entirety of his might, feeling the creatures bones relenting under the impact, squelching ichor gushing from the creatures ragged jaws. A deafening crash of thunder erupts from the blow, the impact sends out shockwaves of exploding in a radiant light around them. A sudden warmth of divine light covers Titus, like a mothers embrace.

The creature emits a blood curdling screech as its body contorts and collapses on itself. The scream fading as the abomination falls to the ground.

Divine warmth clung to Titus's skin like a summers sunlight. He tilts his face skyward, throat tightening. "I... I can feel you," he whispered into the veil where his ancestors watched.

The sensation floods through him-a celestial tether reconnecting him to his Ancestral Titan and, through it, to Lathander himself. Like phantom nerves firing in a limb long severed, then miraculously restored. A single tear carved a path down his battle-worn cheek.

"I believed you fallen with the other gods."

No voice answered from the heavens, yet certainty filled him like wine poured into an empty chalice. His lips curved into a smile. "So be it then. I understand what must follow."

A few glances around, gathering his baring's he sets off for Halvar's Grace for an inevitable confrontation.
