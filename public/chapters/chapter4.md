No one would suspect, stepping through the black oak doors of The Iron Tusk, that the warm lamplight and the din of mug-thumping camaraderie cloaked a mortal hazard. The entire place thrummed with a practiced illusion of safety, comforting to the uninitiated: the fire was fed regularly with cedar, infusing the taproom with a sweet-smoke haze; the coin-heavy regulars, in rumpled doublets and stained jerkins, offered a blunt, collective hum, punctuated by the shrieks of laughter from the barmaids whose faces were as familiar as the creases on a favored dice. Yet the air itself was an ambush, laying in wait the instant you relaxed your guard, a place where even the act of pissing in the shadowed water-closet carried the implied threat of steel wire cinching your throat until your last desperate blink.

The Iron Tusk's proprietor, a former pit-fighter called Juna, kept the surface order with the rhythm and brutality of a gladiator's match, but even she could not scrub the criminal gravity from the air. The walls, if you looked closely enough, bristled with the subdermal tension of the city's most predatory: the oyster-eyed cardsharps, the sandpaper-knuckled bruisers, and those who wore their daggers like wedding bands, never out of arm's reach. They converged nightly, drawn by the promise of coin and secrets, and eyed each newcomer with the consideration a butcher gives a well-fed lamb.

Amidst the clatter and the spilled ale, Dazrian Edgecorde felt the undercurrent instantly. He threaded through the crowd with the showman's ease, playing his part-bemused, harmless, unthreatening-but every step was measured, every smile modulated, lest he invite scrutiny. He knew well that in The Iron Tusk, the biggest danger came not from the reckless fists or the brandished blades, but from the invisible web of alliances and vendettas, the promises made in whispers and paid in blood. The locals had a favorite saying: the taproom floor drank more than the customers.

Tonight the tide ran especially high. Rumors skittered about the border, tales of a cult swelling, a black ulcer on the edge of Kvast, and every would-be informant with a functional tongue tried to barter their scraps of hearsay for a night's credit. Dazrian listened, as he always listened, filtering the truth from the theatre. He noted the subtle shuffles, the meaningful glances, the sudden, nervous hush that dropped like a curtain whenever the conversation strayed too close to the spiral-shrouded symbol, an investigation Dazrian was still piecing together.

The noise and smoke peeled away as Dazrian skirted the perimeter, eyes fixed on the rickety platform at the far end of the taproom-a stage only in the technical sense, cobbled together from scavenged planks and mismatched crates. Nails protruded at odd angles, remnants of a half-dozen failed repairs, and the surface bore the scars of too many clumsy swings from the craftsman's hammer. It was a hazard, a joke, and a sacred altar to every liar or legend desperate enough to earn their supper in the Iron Tusk. Dazrian's boots clacked across the warped boards, sending up tiny puffs of dust, and he stifled a grin at the incongruity. Once, in his father's court, he'd performed to velvet drapes and polished marble, but here…here the curtain was the haze of pipeweed and the expectant hush of predators.

There was comfort in the low expectations. No one demanded artistry from a tavern act, only the illusion of it-a distraction sharp enough to hold the room's attention, if only long enough for someone else to pick a pocket or slip a poison vial into an unattended mug. Dazrian scanned the faces nearest the battered stage: a knot of sailors with tattooed knuckles, a lean man in priestly black whose eyes never quite focused, a sullen trio crowded around a single, battered bottle of whiskey. All of them looked up as he mounted the platform, their appetites shifting from ale to whatever bloodsport or spectacle he might offer.

He ran a finger absently over the hilt of his father's rapier-hidden beneath his cloak in defiance of local custom. It was luminous, forged to catch the eye as much as any blade could, but Dazrian kept it out of sight. This performance required a different set of weapons. A flick of his wrist produced a lute from the burlap sack at his hip, the instrument's back patched with leather and the frets stained with a century of sweat and spilled spirits. He angled it under the lamplight, tuning pegs creaking in protest, and let the anticipation build as he adjusted the battered stool and surveyed his audience one last time.

They were restless tonight. He could feel it in the way the barmaids lingered near the hearth, in the silence that built at the edge of each joke, and in the way the regulars clutched their tankards with knuckles gone pale. Something was coming, and it wasn't just the rumors. Dazrian set his boot atop the lowest rung of the stool, twisted the lute's body against his chest, and let his voice drop into the hush like the first pebble into a well. He knew every eye was on him, some hoping for a tune worth humming, others for a mistake they could use as leverage or blackmail. Either way, he was the center of the world-and for the next few minutes, that would be enough.

The Iron Tusk punished hesitation. Dazrian's fingers found the strings, his voice rising above the clamor:

"Gather 'round, you scarred-knuckle rovers,

You shadow-eyed hunters of coin-

Lift your cups and still your tongues,

For this ballad bears a burden."

The tavern's rumble faded as Dazrian began to sing.

"From Hollowfen came a soldier once,

His soul a battlefield after war,

Eyes cold as northern stone,

Heart sewn shut from trauma shone."

"He loved a maiden by the rushing ford,

Her hair like embers caught in wind,

Who promised through storm and slaughter

To await his mud-caked boots' return."

The melody silenced even the flies buzzing above spilled ale. The barkeep's rag circled the same tankard endlessly; his eyes fixed on nothing while emotions stirred somewhere beneath his ribs.

"But fate cuts deeper than any soldier's blade;

When he limped home from death's abrade,

His river-maiden gone from the world,

Leaving bloodshot eyes and a heart as dark as coal."

"The lass all alone,

Shadows came in the night,

For the soldier sent off, the Kings war to fight."

"No headstone guards her memory,

No marker bears her name,

Just reeds that bend in evening wind,

A world forever crooked, a heart forever drained."

"So, he tracked the shadows that took her breath,

Hunted them beyond map's edge and reason's reach,

Through forests weeping sap and broken halls of stone,

Each kill paid a debt, each death a promise kept."

"Yet when the last shadow fell,

The hollow did remain

For the two souls were braided together,

the memory of love, now with the slain"

"He wanders still, chest empty as a beggar's purse,

Flesh a shroud for what once lived,

Humming softly her water-song that once called him home."

"So listen close, you battered hearts,

You men of fractured bone-

Love's a war where victory can't be won."

"To Hollowfen! To the lass of rivers-light!

To every calloused hand that reaches for ghosts with all their might!"

"Remember this when the day is done.

Grief is but a melody… Waiting to be sung"

The final note lingered like smoke, suspended in the tavern's thick air. For three heartbeats, not a mug clinked, not a boot scraped the floor. Then the Iron Tusk shuddered with thunder-fists pounding tables, voices rising in hoarse appreciation. Dazrian watched weathered faces transform, saw scarred hands wiping at eyes when they thought no one was looking. His melody had found cracks in their armor, seeping into places these hardened souls had walled off long ago.

For a fraction of a heartbeat, the Iron Tusk felt timeless-everyone, from the gray-bearded regular who hadn't left his stool in five winters to the trembling courier clutching his first mug, bound by a shared ache. It was a rare thing in Kvast: a roomful of strangers, mourning lost lovers and dead friends in unison, swept together by the song's gentle violence. Even the barmaids paused, tankards suspended mid-pour, as the final chord hung in the thick haze of lamp smoke and pipeweed. Only the fire dared speak, popping and settling, as if it too grieved something it could not name.

Then, as if the universe resented the calm, the doors of the Iron Tusk were flung open with a violence that snapped the spell in two. The frigid wind roared in first, scattering loose coins and candle stubs across the floor, and a second later came the messenger: a boy, no more than fourteen, white-eyed and blood-streaked, his voice already hoarse from screaming.

"Reapers! Reapers are here!" The shriek was ragged, not the melodramatic wail of drunks stirring trouble but animal panic, the sound of a thing cornered by something it had only ever heard about in warning tales. For a half-second, no one moved-then the name rippled through the taproom like a thrown dagger, and the stillness burst into chaos.

The Tithe Reapers. Their mere mention made mothers clutch their children closer and hardened veterans flee. These crimson-and-white-cloaked executioners of the 5th Penitent Legion served as the Crown's merciless scalpel, cutting away what Saint-King Halvar deemed impure. Eighteen years had passed since The Cleansing, when entire villages vanished overnight, leaving only blood-painted spirals on thresholds as testament. The tales still circulated in hushed tones-of priests hanging inverted from makeshift crosses, their theological crimes purged drop by bloody drop; of families dragged screaming from homes for harboring forbidden icons; of Halvarism's bloody ascension as Thaldrenne's sole permissible faith. Women were deemed vessels of impurity under Halvar's doctrine, though anyone with eyes could see the doctrine stemmed from the King's own inadequacies. The royal proclamations never mentioned his rumored impotence, of course-but the viciousness with which the Reapers enforced the laws against women spoke volumes about what truly haunted the throne.

Unable to produce an heir, the whole land prayed to live long enough to see the Halvar bloodline fade.

Kvast had clung to the notion that border towns might be spared, that the Crown's terrible justice would halt at the fringe of civilization. Most of the Iron Tusk's current patrons were living proof of that gamble-runaways, defectors, thieves who thought an extra day's ride west would blunt the edge of royal retribution. Now the last of their illusions evaporated, replaced by the animal logic of self-preservation.

The tavern became a hive of panic: chairs overturned, tables upended for makeshift barricades, tankards and knives snatched up without thought. Some of the more practiced criminals melted into the shadows, using the confusion to slip through back corridors or up the narrow servant's stair that led to the rats' nest of crawlspaces above the main floor. Others, frozen by dread or too drunk to function, simply dropped to their knees and began to pray-some to the sanctioned gods, some to whatever happened to be listening.

Dazrian stood perfectly still on his stage dissecting the terror around him for what it was: an old, reliable script. Calculating his next move he knew, the ones who ran would be ran down and trampled, their blood feeding the grim reputation of the Reapers. The ones who hid would be found, dragged into the street for public demonstration along with whoever else they deemed unclean. Those who tried to resist would die quickly, if they were lucky. The rest would watch, remember, and never forget the lesson.

He scanned the crowd, calibrating his next move. The rough mercenary in the back had gone white as a candle, clutching the table as if it might keep him afloat. The knot of sailors bared their teeth, already drawing blades, but the panic in their eyes betrayed their bravado. Juna, the barkeep, calmly fetched the ironwood club from beneath her counter-a weapon hefted as a warning, not a plan. Dazrian admired her composure, even as the odds of surviving the next hour thinned with every breath.

Outside, the shrieking had sharpened, a rising pitch that meant blood already coated the ground. The shattered voice of the boy-messenger was gone, as if devoured by the snow and night, leaving only a handprint on the threshold and a memory of terror smeared across the tavern's planked floor.

He lingered at the door for a heartbeat, listening. Beyond the wailing, there was the savage percussion of axe meeting wood, the howl of a woman who was being drug into the street for repentance, the flat report of bodies hitting the ground. Even the hard-faced mercenaries inside the Tusk fell silent, their bravado dissolving at the certainty of what waited outside.

Dazrian's hand went by reflex to his rapier, the muscles remembering every lesson drilled into him by the old man since he could walk. He thought of the stories: how the great Fauran Edgecorde had once held a bridge against a hundred men, how he had laughed as he bled, how he had died without ever conceding a step. Dazrian wondered whether any of the tales were true, or if they were just another kind of performance-something to be admired, even as you cursed the cost. Now, standing in the dusk-swallowed vestibule with the world collapsing outside, he knew only this: if he was to die here, it would be with style, with a flourish, with his name on the lips of at least one survivor.

The Iron Tusk's door was heavy, built for sieges. Tonight it was pointless as a prayer. He kicked it open-no sense in sneaking now-and was met by a chaos more honest than any audience's applause. The town center was a butcher's stage: armored men sundered the crowd with pikes and swords, corralling survivors into neat, writhing knots. Some targets were dispatched with clinical efficiency; others were held just long enough for friends and family to watch, a lesson in futility and the price of dissent.

He ducked low, moving through the haze-smoke from burning banners, steam rising from spilled guts-and picked his mark. The commander. It was always the commander. Find the head, cut it, and hope the body remembered how to run.

His gaze locked onto the veteran captain at the street's center, Ser Draven Thane. Barely twenty, his face was an unsettlingly perfect mask of noble arrogance, untouched by the brutal realities that surrounded him. His armor gleamed in the light, a mockery of purity amidst the chaos. Thane stood as an island of calm in the storm, every command issued with pitiless precision, each gesture both a blessing and a curse. Dazrian felt the old resentment gnaw at his core-some men inherited power like sacred relics, while others had to tear it from the world's bleeding heart.

Dazrian lunged forward through a hellscape where severed limbs that curled like pale worms in puddles of viscera. The first Reaper who blocked him had a face split by an old wound-lips permanently peeled back to reveal yellowed teeth in a half-skull grin. The man's knuckles bulged white around his pike. Dazrian feinted, and as the veteran lurched past, his rapier found the femoral artery. The blade parted flesh with a wet sucking sound, the wound gaped obscenely, muscle tissue gleaming pink beneath the torn breeches that released thick, rhythmic gouts of blood that pooled on the ground beneath Dazrians feet.

A second Reaper charged, eyes dulled and hazy like boiled eggs in a face twisted with bloodlust. His spear thrust for Dazrian's sternum, but Dazrian dropped, feeling his palms shred on gravel and broken teeth scattered across the ground. Rolling up behind the man, he slashed through the hamstrings-the tendons separating with the sound of wet rope snapping. The Reaper's legs buckled backward at unnatural angles, with bone no longer able to support his weight jutted through skin as he collapsed shrieking, hands clawing frantically at the mud now turning to a slurry of blood and shit beneath him. Through it all, Dazrian's gaze remained fixed on Thane, even as arterial spray speckled his vision red.

Each movement brought new carnage-a throat opened to reveal the glistening cartilage of the trachea, a single slice erupting the belly spilling bowels that writhed like eels on the ground. His sword no longer felt like metal but like a living thing extension thriving on the bloodlust it created. The muffled prayers of the dying bubbled through punctured lungs around him, frothy pink spittle on blue lips as they drowned in their own fluids. Guilt couldn't touch him here-not with the copper taste of other men's blood in his mouth and the wet, meaty sounds of his blade finding home in human flesh.

Thane's eyes widened, a mix of fear and admiration coloring his alabaster face. Dazrian allowed more of Thane's Reapers to converge, relishing the metallic undertone of blood beneath the cool air. The first, a hulking brute, swung an axe with a murderous arc, its edge slicing through air and earth. Dazrian moved with elegant grace, slipping inside the swing, his rapier's crossguard finding the tender underside of the man's chin. Bone gave way with a sickening crunch, yellow teeth scattering like shattered porcelain into the mud. As the brute's eyes glazed over, The rapier's resistance gave way with a sickening glide, steel scraping bone before punching through the orbital cavity, like puncturing an overripe plum's skin before meeting the sudden hardness of its pit.

The second opponent-barely sixteen, with acne craters pocking his cheeks-shook so violently his sword point traced figure-eights in the air. His first strike came wide; Dazrian sidestepped it with contemptuous ease. The boy lunged again, overextending. Dazrian's rapier flicked upward with surgical precision, the tip puncturing soft flesh beneath the jaw, driving through the tongue, palate, and into the brain pan. Blood erupted skyward with force. The boy's eyes rolled back to whites as his body convulsed once, twice, then collapsed into the mud, twitching in death throes while piss soaked through his breeches.

Thane stepped forward, confidence mingling with a begrudging respect. Dazrian exhaled, embracing the tempest he'd become.

In the square's center, they clashed, encircled by those paralyzed by fear. Steel met steel with the sharp, clean break of glass. Thane fought with disciplined fury, his heavy sword a study in efficient brutality. But Dazrian danced around him, his rapier a scalpel probing for weakness, his mind free from fear's shackles.

Thane's greatsword whistled downward, steel keening as it missed Dazrian's shoulder by the width of a breath before burying itself in the mud. Dazrian pirouetted, his rapier's tip tracing a silver arc that stopped a finger's breadth from the captain's jugular, drawing a primal roar from the captain. Sweat stung Dazrian's eyes as he ducked another killing arc, feeling the wind of it part his hair. Thane's face contorted into something barely human-nostrils flared, teeth bared in a rictus of hatred, spittle flying with each thunderous swing that found only empty space where Dazrian had been heartbeats before.

Finally, Thane managed to land a glancing blow, the edge of his blade slicing through Dazrian's breeches to open a shallow cut that burned like liquid fire across his outer thigh. Yet Dazrian's counterattack found the soft promise of flesh where Thane's greaves creased at the hip, the rapier's tip puncturing chainmail with a sound like coins falling into a well. The pristine white surcoat bloomed with a spreading rose of blood that darkened to burgundy at its edges. Desperation contorted Thane's aristocratic features into a feral snarl, driving him harder, his breath coming in ragged gasps that fogged the night air. But Dazrian anticipated each misstep, each wild swing revealing the gap in Thane's discipline, each desperate thrust an invitation to counter.

Their blades collided with a metallic scream, sparks showering down like stars falling to earth. Dazrian felt fire in every muscle as he spun inside Thane's guard, grabbing the captains wrist. He felt bones shift and snap beneath the skin as they relented from being wrenched skyward. Thane opened his mouth to cry out, but no sound emerged as Dazrian's rapier sought and found the gap between armor plates. The blade sank through with elegant precision, parting chainmail, then flesh, then deeper still, penetrating a soft hollow interior. Warm blood flooded over Dazrian's knuckles in steady waves, each surge growing weaker than the last as Thane's life ebbed away beneath his hand.

As Thane's eyes widened in disbelief,and confusion, Dazrian leaned close enough to feel the captain's final breaths warm against his cheek. "Hold your questions, Ser Daven, the dead receive no answers," he whispered, twisting his blade with deliberate slowness before extracting it from flesh. The captain's body slacking against him, before cascading to the ground.

The square drowned in silence. The Reapers, recognizing their leader's fall, surged forward as one. Outnumbered, Dazrian spotted his escape a frantic, riderless horse, tethered but restless, its mouth frothing with panic. Vaulting onto it, he urged the beast into motion, casting a final glance at the lost town. Fires consumed the thatched rooftops, bodies lay as offerings to despair, and beyond the conflagration, a silhouette fought on, ironwood club in hand.

Dazrian guided his mare through the dense Sivandier woods, following half-forgotten logger trails until her flanks heaved beneath him. He eased her to a trot. Her heart hammered against his calves-any harder and the beast might collapse. The Legion would need weeks to track him this far into the wilderness. With practiced hands, he obscured their trail using methods his father had taught him long ago-memories that ached he held on to in moments like these. Both rider and mount needed rest. Without the comfort of a fire, he settled against a gnarled oak, his elven ears straining against the forest's whispers as he slipped into his meditative trance.

Cold seized him-not the night's chill, but something ancient. Chains rattled somewhere beyond sight. Muffled whimpers escaped from within restrained throats. The vision crystallized: a courtyard, its cobblestones permanently stained a deep rose with generations of spilled blood. A man knelt before him, face streaked with tears. As the chains grew louder the executioner raised his axe. A detail catches his eye. Carved into the chopping block, a blood-drawn sigil-a perfect spiral a crown adorned with thorns-identical to the marks Legion priests painted on village thresholds after their "cleansings."

Despite the danger of returning to Thaldrenne after the bloodshed he'd left behind, Dazrian recognized the summons for what it was. Something ancient had found him, recognized his bloodline, sense his capabilities.

Dazrian knew where he had to go. "There's only one place I know that has bloodstained cobble stones like that" Anxiety runs through him like an arrow.  
<br/>"Halvar's Grace" He says as he shakes his head, letting out a sighed breath followed by a chuckle  
<br/>"If they don't execute me on sight," he muttered, already plotting his course back.
