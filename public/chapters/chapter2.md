A chime from a flipped coin rang out, the bright, brief note swallowed by the thick velvet of the crowded chamber. Maldan Breen watched the coin tumble, glittering faintly in the lightly filled with smoke, before snatching it from the air, a gesture so practiced it may as well be a tic. He repeated the motion, letting the rhythm of metal and flesh steady his pulse as he studied his mark inside the tavern at

Braymon March, a senior treasurer of the Gilded Ledger, sat at the far end among a retinue of lesser merchants and decorative cousins. March was a man who announced his appetites in his every contour-his belly pressed against the table's edge, his cheeks pink and shiny as waxed apples, his thinning hair lacquered to his scalp in a futile campaign against the onslaught of age. He had the self-satisfaction of a man whose every failure was someone else's fault, and whose every indulgence was a just reward rather than a vice. Maldan could already see, in the way March fondled his painted snuff box and rolled his tongue over his teeth after every sweet, the precise pressure points that would shatter him.

But this was no ordinary game, no mere fleecing of some soft-palmed noble too foolish to know the stakes. The air in the room pulled with more than just the promise of gold. The other patrons at the table eyed one another with wary, appraising glances of predators forced to share a watering hole. A pair of city guardsmen, likely on March's retainer-leaned against the far wall, arms folded, faces impassive. The wine steward circled with a nervous energy that suggested he'd never served so many high-ranking gluttons in one evening. Even the chandelier seemed to tremble in anticipation, casting a thousand nervous shadows over the brocade and marble.

Once, Maldan would have drunk in these details with the hypervigilance of the hunted-listening for the shuffle of boots in the alley, memorizing the exits, tracing the pattern of the guards' patrols in his mind's eye. But tonight, he was the wolf in silk, and every wary eye was bent on someone else. He flicked the coin again, a little harder this time, and caught it on the back of his hand without looking. An old mentor had taught him the trick the winter he'd been conscribed as a lookout for the Kremont Brotherhood. "When you're scared, boy, let the coin do the talking. Sometimes you gotta' make your own luck" His luck sent him straight to the bottom of an unmarked grave, his body never found.

Maldan's gaze drifted from March to the crowd beyond-hawks and jackals dressed in velvet, their laughter competing with the music for volume. He'd spent years learning the dialect of the powerful, the precise ratio of self-deprecation and flattery needed to crack the shell of those who'd never known hunger. The memory of his first masquerade in these hallowed halls was never far: how the mask cut into his cheekbones, how the wine stung his empty stomach, how he'd mimicked their careless indolence until it grew into something like truth. He watched the way March laughed at the joke of a minor viscount, the way his eyes flicked to the door even as he clutched his waistline, a subtlety as bright as day to someone like Maldan.

The elites of Caer Dusk are lazy, overfed pride of peacocks blinded by luxury. Their hubris would never allow them to consider a predator prowled among them. Maldan Breen had survived decades in the streets by making them believe he belonged-practicing in the stifling warrens made of black bread and coal smoke-and by flipping a tarnished coin in his palm to steel his nerve. Every time he slipped into a candlelit salon with gilded wainscoting or breathed perfumed air through a noble's parlor, he ran through the old routines: mirror the drawl, slope the wrist, wear detachment like varnish. Never so perfectly they'd suspect, always a half-step shy of conviction. Laugh at yourself first, let them supply the punchline, and they'll trust you twice as fast with half as many questions.

Maldan's skillset allowed him to become whoever he wanted, whenever it was convenient for him. A skillset that will get you far in this town. Tonight, was special. A persona set in motion months in advance. Tonight, he was Marnet Cuirloch.

Marnet Cuirloch- now conveniently expired under a sewer flagstone-serving as Maldan's mask for the past seven nights among the Gilded Ledger's elite. The real Cuirloch had been Uvraine's envoy. Uvrainers were known for their lack of subtlety. Maldan honored this reputation by downing aquavit that burned his throat raw, chewing loudly on salt-crusted delicacies while twirling the ends of his singed mustache theatrically. His hair untamed, flowing, and dark, something he would have to get used to. His presence claiming space as he prowled the carpets as if he owned every inch, bellowing preposterous tales, playing the part like a seasoned actor. Maldan flipped his coin-a tarnished silver blessed by Maskaros, its edges worn thin by years of deceit. There was never a situation that he didn't touch with a bit of risk. He wove danger into the game like a thread, a game within a game.

Heads, and he'd spin a lie so outrageous even the gods would blush-like claiming to have bedded the Hollow Queen herself. Tails, and he'd offer a calculated vulnerability, some morsel of truth to make his marks lean closer, thinking they glimpsed the man behind the mask. The coin never truly decided his fate; it merely provided the thrill of surrender. Maldan needed that edge of chaos, that whisper of risk. Without it, the game grew stale, predictable. A master lockpick needs resistance in the tumblers. "Everyone lies," he'd whisper to himself in quiet moments, fingers caressing the worn silver, "mortals, gods... I just happen to be honest about it."

Tonight, after spending the week infiltrating its ranks, The Gilded Ledger would become his opus. As he walks in the corner table sits the prize: Braymon March, a triple-chinned architect of ugly ducal bloodlines, drowning in gin while his Royal Audient hovered behind, gloved hands clasped, ears harvesting every whisper in the room. As Maldan enters his eyes dart around, sizing up every face, finding every exit, calculating angles. The rehearsed smile cutting through the crowd, you don't spend seventeen years perfecting the art of deception without learning that a properly timed smile can separate a man from more than his coin.

The day's work had been meticulous fingers dancing across twenty different household ledgers in the market quarter's back rooms, planting false deficits like seeds that would sprout blame by morning. Each falsified balance, each doctored entry positioned March's companions as the perfect scapegoats. Now came the culmination: the vault key that dangled from Braymon's belt chain, waiting to be liberated. A rehearsed act, the imperceptible transfer from belt to palm to sleeve. Heads meant charm, tails meant stealth, but either way, the key would change hands before the night was through.

Braymon's voice cracked through the smoky tavern, a booming, roguish laugh that skittered over tables and hearth light. He fixed Maldan with a grin wide as a canyon, from a table of empty dinner plates and tankards alike. Craving friendship and camaraderie with Maldan so fiercely his voice trembled. But Maldan's gaze was a dark jewel, held in calculated repose, reflecting only the faintest spark of warmth. Braymon thundered, "Marnet! Come here, you bastard!" and Maldan merely inclined his head, an actor stepping onto a stage he alone had written.

Braymon lunged into questions, his tone gallant with concern. "I never thought we'd see you tonight-what of your negotiations, the morning's work?" His eyes glittered, unknowing of the razor concealed beneath the manufactured comradery. Maldan's lips curved in rehearsed ease. "Work can rot and fade into lasting memories! One last night of revelry, yes?" He raised his cup, every syllable a silken lie. The chant of pipe and lute swelled as Braymon waved him to the nearest bench, dismissing the company he was keeping. With each cup Braymon drained, Maldan's single goblet remained untouched, its surface like a black mirror.

Under flickering torchlight, Braymon's cheeks deepened to bruised red, his speech mellowing to honeyed staves. Maldan watched every falter of his new friend's tongue, every glass poured by eager servers, as pieces sliding into place. A slow, deliberate shift forward, and Maldan produced his coin: an heirloom, cold, but comforting. It danced from thumb to forefinger-an omen of risk to come. He savored the metallic clink upon the oaken table, eyes sharpening. Then, out of the corner of his vision, he sees her: a figure draped in shadow, her pupils glinting with dreadful certainty, a sigil on her forehead meticulously carved, like an artist sculpting a monument. A perfectly symmetrical spiral, with a tarnished crown wrapped in thorns sits atop. Her lips curved in that mocking, knowing smile- "You're found, thief. Your gambit ends here."

Maldan's breath hitched. The coin escaped him, spinning, and his stomach knotted; he hadn't dropped it in twenty winters. He lunged, seized it, but when he glanced back the stranger had melted into the smoke. Panic flayed his mind: who was she? What doom awaited him? Braymon's drunken roar thundered past his dread: "Always flipping that damn coin! But never losing your nerve, eh?" The moment cracked like ice. Maldan lurches to his feet, eyes raking the shadows for the cloaked figure. "Excuse me," he mutters, already shoving past bodies that blur into obstacles. The smoke-choked chamber swallows his breath as he plunges through the kitchens where grease sizzles and curses fly. A dark shape darts through the back door-there! He lunges, muscles coiling, then explodes into a sprint. A serving girl screams as he knocks her tray skyward, amber liquid raining down as he crashes outside.

The alley stretches empty in both directions, torch flames guttering like dying souls. His heart hammers against his ribs, sweat slicking his palms as he whirls, searching for any betraying movement. Nothing. Just the mocking silence of the night.

"Where the FUCK are you going?!" Braymon's voice slurs behind him, thick with drink and suspicion. The man sways like a tree in high wind, spittle gleaming on his chin, veins bulging in his neck from the effort of standing.

'Pathetic worm,' Maldan thinks, bile rising in his throat. 'To be rid of you will be the best part of this night.'

"Nowhere important," Maldan purrs, mask sliding back into place. "Thought I saw someone I once bedded."

"OHHH!" Braymon's face splits into a leering grin, eyes fever-bright. "Marnet, you rutting BEAST!" His laughter erupts, spraying flecks of saliva.

Maldan forces a chuckle as his fingers dig into Braymon's shoulder like talons. His other hand strikes like a viper, slithering to Braymon's waist, fingertips scraping against metal, closing around the vault key with a thief's caress, seizing opportunity, half focused while his eyes dart around in suspicion of the shadows around him.

A scream rips through the air as kitchen staff surge forward. Maldan's vision tunnels when Braymon's body crashes into the cobblestones with a wet thud that vibrates through his boots. The cooled metal of the vault key burns his fist while Braymon writhes at his feet, hands clawing frantically at his throat, a gaping maw of separated flesh. Blood erupts in violent, rhythmic pulse, painting Maldan's face and clothes in hot, metallic spray. Each desperate gasp sends scarlet bubbles frothing between Braymon's fingers, as he tries to force the flesh of his severed throat back together to the sound of desperation. His eyes, rife with terror, lock onto Maldan's with betrayal. The gurgling from his ruined throat grows fainter as his life drains. Then his eyes glaze, pupils dilating into black wells as the last tremors rack his body, leaving nothing but a shell leaking warmth into the stones taking with it every hollow ambition, and regrets from a loveless life.

His cover shattered; every blade now pointed at him. Maldan stumbles back in shock, heart pounding like war drums.

"I… Wait…I" Maldan stammers before the voice in his head hits.

"Run you fool, there's no redemption from this"

The alley beyond stinks of rotting waste, decomposing carcasses from the night's dinner left out for the strays and the desperate. He darts down a narrow channel, flipping into shadows and cutting over blind stairwells. Behind him, the echo of boots: Reavers, no doubt, certain of the murder he didn't commit.

As he whispered to Maskaros the world blurred, footsteps rattled off the walls behind him, and false echoes spilled into the street. He slipped through a stone arch, darkness swallowing him, carrying only the memory of a Braymon's gargled pleas and the sigil on the forehead of the stranger whos blade disrupted the perfect game.

There is no sound now, no commotion or scuttle. Just the silence falling over a now foggy night. The streets are emptied, no doubt the Reavers doing. Clearing them out checking anyone who they deemed suspicious.  
<br/>Maldan takes a step forward, out of the darkness that protected him. He places his feet with intent, every step deliberate, not making a sound as he works his way to an abandoned house in the lower ward. A place he knows all too well, the only place he knows will be truly safe for the night.

Huddled in the corner he fights the oncoming sleep. Replaying the nights events repeatedly in his head. The blood still smeared across his face and the clothes borrowed from the Uvraine who no longer needed them. 'A gift for the part' he thought.

Pain lances through Maldan's skull as exhaustion finally claims him. His eyes snap open to blood-stained cobblestones stretching beneath his feet, a permanent witness to a horrific slaughter. Cathedral bells toll, disorienting him despite years of navigating unfamiliar cities. The clanking of chains reverberates inside his skull, followed by muffled whimpering that hooks into his conscience. Before him, a condemned man kneels at a block darkened by countless executions, tears carving clean tracks down his filthy cheeks. A cleric's proclamation booms across the courtyard, words indistinct yet somehow final. The executioner raises his axe. It falls. The crowd exhales as one.

Maldan jolts awake on the floor, gulping air like a drowning man. Braymon's dried blood still crusts his hands, the vault key cold between his fingers. "The vault will be watched," he whispers, "no matter when I go." The dream pulses behind his eyes, but one detail burns clearest-the executioner's axe pommel bearing a spiral sigil crowned with thorns.

"Fuck me, Halvar's Grace?" He mutters in disbelief.

Darkness remains over the streets as he retrieves an emergency pack that he placed. An old habit, taught to him by a mentor lost to time. "Someone destroyed me, I need to know who."

Before dawn breaks, Maldan slips from Caer Dusk, likely forever, bound for a city where tricksters like him face the headsman's blade. Somehow, it's the only path forward.
