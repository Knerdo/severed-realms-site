## I. The Creature's Head

Returning to the world of Terevas, the group headed back to the **Balor Estate** after killing the Riven known as **Mira**. En route, they stopped at **Eddy Ric Voss's farm** to inform the family that the creature eating their livestock was dead, presenting Mira's severed head as proof.

The farmer, cantankerous as ever, accepted the grim trophy without thanks. The goats Billy and Billy watched from the fence. **Tav** the sheep bleated a quiet farewell.

Upon returning to the estate, the team rested and waited for nightfall. Under the cover of darkness, they took the boat provided by **Lady Isilde Balor** and headed toward the **Thane Warehouse** to steal the ledger.

## II. Reunion at the Warehouse

While the group scoped out the situation from the shadows, **Maldan Breen** arrived at the same location. His investigation into the dead man's signature found on crates at Arathus Kexor's lair had led him straight to the Thane Warehouse.

Reunited, the group easily infiltrated the building. They split up briefly: **Dazrian Edgecorde** went to the office, while **Titus Granitefist** and **Erevan** searched the crates after hearing faint whimpers from within.

Titus, after breaking his knife trying to pry a lid open, found a crowbar that finished the job. One tug revealed **Miri**—a halfling child slave from the Southern Wastes, sold to House Thane.

Meanwhile, in the office, Dazrian found the **Black Ledger** and a burlap straw doll—Miri's only possession.

## III. The Confrontation

While searching, the group heard a noise at the main entrance. The doors slammed open, revealing an older man accompanied by three **Tithe Reapers**, a younger man in plate armor, and a woman in a hooded cloak. The group hid out of sight to eavesdrop.

The older man was extremely perturbed, yelling at the younger. They revealed themselves as **Rolan Thane** and his son, **Ser Aldric Thane**. Rolan, the patriarch of House Thane, confronted his son about blundering an operation to obtain a vault key from a senior treasurer named **Braymon March** via the Gilded Ledger.

> "The manifest of slaves from the Southern Wastes is getting lighter because Overlord Kael now requires upfront payment."

Rolan struck Aldric for his failure, shouting:

> "This would have never happened had Daven survived!"

—referring to the Captain Dazrian killed in Kvast.

Before leaving, Rolan asked the hooded woman, now known as **Xero**, why the Veinkai failed the mission. She explained there was an unaccounted error: a con man working Braymon March interrupted the assassination and stole the vault key before she could obtain it.

Rolan ordered them to retrieve the key and left with the Tithe Reapers. Shortly after, Xero departed as well, casting snide comments at Aldric as she went.

## IV. The Combat

**Ser Aldric Thane** was left alone. Seeing their opportunity, the group engaged.

Titus, boiling with rage, began to whistle as he walked toward Aldric. Startled, Aldric shouted:

> "Who's there?!"

Dazrian stepped out from behind the crates. Realizing this was the elf who killed his brother, Aldric flew into a rage and moved to attack.

### The Ambush

**Maldan** cast *Hold Person*, freezing Aldric in place. **Titus** unleashed a *Thunderous Smite*, the booming sound echoing through the warehouse. **Dazrian** approached, took Aldric's sword, and attempted to talk. Aldric told him to go fuck himself, vowing revenge for his brother.

The onslaught continued until Aldric fought to his death.

### The Assassin Returns

**Erevan**, realizing the thunderous noise would draw Xero back, placed a trap at the door. Sure enough, Xero returned, triggered the trap, and was immediately hit by Maldan's *Sleep* spell. Once unconscious, Erevan tied her up.

## V. The Aftermath

With combat ended, Xero lay tied and unconscious. **Maldan Breen** walked over to her. Looking her in the eyes as she slept, he drew his rapier. Without a word, he drove the blade into her ear; she woke only for a split second of sharp pain before the blade pierced her brain, killing her instantly.

The group found a hidden wall with a lift leading down to the **Undercity**. The lift was covered in human waste and blood. Deciding against descending, they agreed the warehouse needed to burn.

After freeing the slaves and getting them to the boat, **Dazrian** set the place ablaze.

The session ended with the group arriving back at **Lady Isilde Balor's** estate, the Black Ledger in hand, and the weight of what they'd learned pressing down on them.
